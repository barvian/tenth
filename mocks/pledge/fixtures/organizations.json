These teachings are today sometimes regarded as exclusively “Catholic.” But in fact, Judaism, and most Christian groups, historically taught many of the same things. The Ruth Institute works with individuals and groups, religious or otherwise, who share our views, in whole or in part, regardless of their positions on other issues.","street1":"4845 Lake St Ste 217","street2":"","city":"Lake Charles","region":"LA","postal_code":"70605","country":"US","lat":"30.1693251","lon":"-93.2318697","cause":"","causes":[{"id":89,"name":"Mental Health","parent_id":80},{"id":80,"name":"Health","parent_id":null}],"website_url":"http://www.ruthinstitute.org/","profile_url":"https://www.pledge.to/organizations/46-3647313/the-ruth-institute","logo_url":"https://pledgeling-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_fit,h_266,w_266/v1/prod-media/images/npos/logos/default/logo.jpg","disbursement_type":"standard","impact_metrics":[],"sustainable_development_goals":[]},
