- q: Are donations tax-deductible?

    Yes, depending on local regulations. All donations are processed by our donation partner [Pledge](https://pledge.to) via Pledgeling Foundation, an IRS approved 501(c)3 entity, and granted to the selected nonprofit.
- q: When are donations made?
  a: |-
    Donations are withdrawn on the 20th of each month, then held for 60 days
    to handle potential disputes. They're then sent to our donation partner [Pledge](https://pledge.to), which batches donations
    for a calendar month together and regrants them to your selected organizations within the first fifteen days of the following month,
    so please allow time for that to happen and for the nonprofit to process the payment. For more information, check the [Pledge support article](https://help.pledgeling.com/support/solutions/articles/36000036084-how-do-i-know-my-donation-was-received-by-the-nonprofit-).
